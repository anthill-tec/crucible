"""CR-CRU-030 §S1 — the shared TOON-AXI envelope module for the client fleet.

Historically the five `*-crucible.py` clients did NOT share code — each
standalone client duplicated its own lifecycle/`.env`/context helpers, and the
`_emit_axi`/`_axi_context` envelope builders existed only in `bun-crucible.py`.
This module factors that envelope machinery out so every client imports it and
emits a byte-identical §S1 envelope:

    axi:
      verb: <name>
      ok: <bool>
      <verb-specific result fields>
      context: { projectKey, agentId?, cycleId?, wave, cr, track?, orchestrator? }
      warnings[]{code,detail}

Scope boundary (per the CR-CRU-030 RED escalation): `axi_context` takes an
ALREADY-RESOLVED `project_key` string, not a project dir — `.env`/project-dir
resolution stays client-specific (each client owns its filesystem layout), so
the shared module never touches the filesystem for key resolution.

The module is loaded by file path by the hyphen-named clients (which are not
importable as normal module names), so it keeps zero hard dependencies on
being on `sys.path`; it loads the sibling `clients/toon.py` codec by path the
same way the clients do.
