## Notes
- 2026-07-14 — Project kickoff: PRD + evidence DN landed. Kickoff design review (lavish)
  locked six decisions: A+B hybrid dashboard (Mission Control home + project workspace
  drill-in); TOON on agent-facing reads first; REST AXI + `crucible-axi` npx CLI; hybrid
  UI stack (VanJS/VanX + Tailwind 4 browser runtime + DaisyUI 5, forge as custom theme);
  clean v2 API at `/api/v2/*` with a thin v1 shim on legacy `/api/*` + client-fleet
  upgrade (shim retires post-migration). Plus: codec translation layer (canonical
  RunSchema, failure detail preserved), ingest-as-implicit-heartbeat, configurable
  liveness thresholds, tombstoned agents, server self-health, BDD harness (later wave).
  Persistence: bun:sqlite (skill-bundle portability); retention rollup.
- 2026-07-14 (later) — Q4 RE-DECIDED during storyboard review: **CR wave first** — no
  pre-built walking skeleton; implementation starts with specs + RED/GREEN/VERIFY
  dispatch per the orchestration flow.
- 2026-07-14 (storyboard close) — Design phase COMPLETE: navigation model approved;
  density verdicts (ideas 1–5, 7 in 0.1.0; filter bar post-0.1.0); run context
  {git, wave, orchestrator} all-optional/graceful; retention 100 + wave rollups; TOON
  subset pinned; BDD harness approved for a later wave. Spike code deleted from tree
  (vendor libs kept). **Queue filed (9 CRs, 4 waves) — specs only; Wave 1 dispatch
  awaits user go.** Post-0.1.0 backlog (not yet filed): filter bar, BDD harness +
  playwright/vitest/tap codecs, shim retirement, coverage-trend deep views.
- 2026-07-15 — Wave 1 executing. CR-CRU-001 shipped (VERIFY CONFIRMED, 12/12 ACs,
  49 tests, 100% fn / 97.6% ln coverage). Scope move at CR-CRU-002 gap-analysis:
  minimal `POST /api/ingest` + `POST /api/ingest/compile` routes move from CR-CRU-003
  into CR-CRU-002 (the codecs' production seam); CR-CRU-003 hardens them to the full
  DN quirk contract + remaining endpoints + contract tests. Deferred register:
  removeAgent no-op change-event; CLI-bootstrap smoke test.
